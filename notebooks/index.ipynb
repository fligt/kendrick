    "Our lab, the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam, currently experiments with direct ionization coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry using Thermo ASAP probe and Orbitrap HRMS. This chemical analysis technique seems well suited to analyze complex polymeric samples. Visualization of the resulting data in so-called Kendrick mass plots provides a means to efficiently explore this type of data. \n",
