    "Our lab, the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam, currently experiments with direct ionization coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry using Thermo ASAP probe and Orbitrap HRMS. This chemical analysis technique seems well suited to analyze complex polymeric samples. Visualization of the resulting data in so-called Kendrick mass plots provides a means to efficiently explore this type of data. \n",

    "Creating these plots with Excel is tedious and prone to error. Aim of the `kendrick` Python package is to facilitate the automatic creation of Kendrick mass plots from our raw data. Our aim is to make this open source package available soon. This code is developed out in the open. If you can't wait, you already can take a look at our documentation and notebooks."
