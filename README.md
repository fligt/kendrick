Our lab, the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam, currently
experiments with direct ionization coupled with high resolution mass
spectrometry using Thermo ASAP probe and Orbitrap HRMS. This chemical
analysis technique seems well suited to analyze complex polymeric
samples. Visualization of the resulting data in so-called Kendrick mass
plots provides a means to efficiently explore this type of data.

Creating these plots with Excel is tedious and prone to error. Aim of
the `kendrick` Python package is to facilitate the automatic creation of
Kendrick mass plots from our raw data. Our aim is to make this open
source package available soon. This code is developed out in the open.
If you canâ€™t wait, you already can take a look at our documentation and
notebooks.
